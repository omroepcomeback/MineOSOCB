## How to install?

The easiest way is to use default **pastebin** script. Insert OpenOS floppy disk to computer, insert an Internet Card, turn computer on and type the following to console:

	pastebin run 0nm5b1ju

After a moment, a nice system installer will be shown. You will be prompted to select your preferred language, select and format a boot volume, create a user profile and customize some settings. After that, the system will be successfully installed.
